  Exercises:
    1,
    Generic trait MyPredicate[-T] (contravariant type) , returns Boolean
    -> have a small method to test whether a value of type T passes a condition
    so every subclass of "MYPredicative[T]" will actually have a different implementation of that little method which tests whether the "T" passes that condition

    class EvenPredication extends MyPredicate[Int]
    ->the method will take an Int and will return wether that Int is even or not



    2,
    Generic Trait MyTransformer[-A,B] (contravariant type on A)
    -> have a small method ("transform") to convert a parameter of type "A" into a value of type "B"
    so every subclass of "MyTransformer" will have a different implementation of that method

    class StringToIntTransformer extends MyTransformer(String, Int)
    -> the method "transform" will just return the desired type

    3,
    Implement function on MyList
      -map(transformer) returns MyList of a different type
      -filter(predicate) returns Mylist
      -flatMap(transformer)from a to MyList[B] and returns MyList[B]

      if we have the list [1,2,3]
        -> for map, if the condition is double all the elements, the output will be the list[2,4,6]
        -> for filter, if we want to return when a number is even, the output should be list[2]
        -> for flatMap, if we want a list like [n, n+1] the output should be [2,3,4] AND at the same type, the element, so it's like a concatenation of all sublists [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]
          little pseudocode: [1,2,3].flatMap[n => n, n+1] = [1,2,2,3,3,4]



     for exercises 1 and 2 instructor said "just accept" the contravariant types, otherwise code won't compile and the reason is a rabbit hole
